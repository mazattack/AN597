## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Module 4

These are my records and notes of Module 4.

### Challenge 1:
First, create a vector of 1 word character strings comprising the first line of the Ulysses, by James Joyce: “Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed.”


1. rename sentence 
2. remove punctuation
3. Split sting, "strsplit"

```{r split}
x<-"Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed." #must use R quotes not sentence quotes
x2<-((gsub("[[:punct:]]","",x))) #does not remove quote marks
xspt<-c(unlist(strsplit(x2," "))) #creates as a list, so used unlist function
```

Then, extract every third element of this vector.
```{r extract}
extract<- xspt[seq(from=3, to=22, by = 3)]
```

HOORAY!

###Challenge 2

```{r matrix, echo=TRUE}
m <- matrix(data = 1:80, nrow = 8, ncol = 10, byrow = FALSE)
m
```
1. Given the matrix, m, above, extract the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th columns and assign them to the variable x
```{r extract columns}
x<-m[,c(2,3,6)]
x
```
2.Given the matrix, m, above, extract the 6th to 8th row and assign them to the variable x
```{r extract rows}
x<-m[c(6:8),]
x
```

3. Given the matrix, m, above, extract the elements from row 2, column 2 to row 6, column 9 and assign them to the variable x
```{r extract matrix}
x<-m[c(2:6),c(2:9)]
x
```
