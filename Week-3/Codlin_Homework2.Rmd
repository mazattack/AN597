#Homework 2

Every Saturday, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest in the morning and listens for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. 
  Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number calls she will hear in that time is exactly 15. 
  Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session.

What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?
What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?
What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?
Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.
Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).
Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?

Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is the probability distribution of independent event occurrences in an interval. If λ is the mean occurrence per interval, then the probability of having x occurrences within a given interval is:

       x -λ
f(x) = λ-e-- where x = 0,1,2,3,...
        x!
Problem
If there are twelve cars crossing a bridge per minute on average, find the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge in a particular minute.

Solution
The probability of having sixteen or less cars crossing the bridge in a particular minute is given by the function ppois.
```{r}
ppois(16, lambda=12)   # lower tail 
#[1] 0.89871
#Hence the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge in a minute is in the upper tail of the probability density function.

ppois(16, lambda=12, lower=FALSE)   # upper tail 
#[1] 0.10129
#Answer: If there are twelve cars crossing a bridge per minute on average, the probability of having seventeen or more cars crossing the bridge in a particular minute is 10.1%.
```
#Answers
##What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?
```{r}
round(ppois(8, lambda=15, lower.tail=FALSE), 3)
```
##What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?
```{r}
round(ppois(0, lambda=15),7)
```
##What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?
```{r}
round(dpois(3, lambda=15),5) #dpois is exact while ppois is with tail
```
##Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30
```{r}
barplot(dpois(x=0:30, lambda=15), ylim=c(0,0.15), space=0, names.arg=0:30, ylab="Probability", xlab="# of calls", col=rainbow(20))
```

##Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions). Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?

```{r}
sim<-rpois(n=104, lambda=15)
hist(sim, ylim=c(0,30), xlim=c(0,30), ylab="frequency", xlab="simulated observed call count", main="simulated frequency of call counts", col="aquamarine") 
```
 
This histogram shows the simulated frequency of observed calls over a two year period. It generally seems to be a fair approximation of a normal distribution.
